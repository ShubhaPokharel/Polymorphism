# Polymorphism
Polymorphism is derived from  greek words - poly(many) + morphism(forms).


So, Polymorphism means one functionality with different behaviors in java.

ex: ---- Shubha ----> In school she is a student.

                        In a mall she is a customer.
                        
                       At home she is a daughter.
                       
          
          There are two types of Polymorphism: 
          
          1 - Compile time polymorphism / static binding: method overloading
          2- Runtime polymorphsm / dynamic binding: method overriding
